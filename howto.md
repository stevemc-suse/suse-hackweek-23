**Demo Enviroment**

This is a demo enviroment using Linux and KVM, Your going to need a resalably well spec'd machine for this that hast the caplablity of running virtual machines. 

Here's my machine as an example: 
**Spec** 
    -Intel I5 9500 CPU 
    -32 GB Mem (Max for this hardware) get more if you can. 
    -256GB Nvme 
    -256GB SSD
    - Network jack 
    - Network Wifi
    
- Senario 1 
-   Using openSUSE Micro OS
-       This will give you a webUi for your virtual machines as well as ssh access to the machine. 

- Senaio 2 
-       Using full Linux, I'm using openSUSE for this with KVM installed the hardware itself is configured to provide remote access over serial, so there is no need for screen and keyboard. 


Both senarios can offer the same expreance of use depending on the skill of the user.
